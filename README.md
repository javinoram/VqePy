# vqesimulation for condensed matter physics

This repository save the code for the vqe simulation of condensed matter physics
Here, different version of the vqe method are implemented, the requirement's application are:
1. Qiskit
2. Numpy
3. Scipy
4. Plotly

The main idea of the code is to test the VQE performance in different models of the condensed matter
and see the numerical error of the method.

### How to use the code
The main object is the VQEclass.py, as the name say, this is a python class where all the information of the hamiltonian
is store in order to have in a only place the enough information to perform the calculation over the hamiltonian.

In this the different VQE method are defined ...
