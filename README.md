# Tesis project
Project to get the degree of computer science.

The main idea is use variational quantum algorithms the study condensed matter's models,
the fields of interest are the following.
1. Spin systems
2. 2D materials
3. Molecules

# Libraries
1. pennylane
2. numpy
3. scipy
4. matplotlib
5. pennylane-qiskit
6. pennylane-cirq

# Requirements
It's recommended create a virtual enviroment and install all the libraries indicated in the requiremets.txt. 

``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```

# Methods
The method considerated to be applied in the different models are:
1. Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with penalty terms
2. VQE for structure optimization
3. Get upper level using VQE
4. Use VQE for upper spines
5. Variational quantum thermalizer

Not all method can be used in some types of hamiltonian.
